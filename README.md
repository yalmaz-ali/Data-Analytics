# Data Science Project: Students Dataset

This project is an exploration and analysis of the Students dataset using data science techniques. It includes data visualization, preprocessing, and various insights derived from the dataset. The code is written in Python and uses popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `hello_world.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project.
- `the-hello-dataset-fa22`: Dataset containing students information.
- `cleanedHelloWorldData.csv`: Cleaned dataset obtained after preprocessing.
- `graphs_hello/`: Directory containing the generated graphs and visualizations.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yalmaz-ali/Data-Analytics.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd Data-Analytics
```

3. Install the required Python Libraries:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Usage:
  - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
  ```shell
